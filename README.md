# Hangman Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the Hangman game project. This version of the classic word guessing game is designed to run in command-line interface. Challenge yourself to guess the word before your man gets hanged!

## Features
- Possibility to select a language (English/Russian).
- At the start, the app lets you start a new game or quit.
- When a new game starts, it picks a word randomly, and you begin to guess it.
- After you guess a letter, it shows how many mistakes you've made and the hangman's current state with ASCII art.
- After the game ends, it shows if you won or lost and goes back to letting you start a new game or quit.
